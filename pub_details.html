<B> Brant Jones, <I>Rational generating series for affine permutation pattern avoidance</I></B><P>
<BR>
We explain how to enumerate the set of affine permutations that avoid a given permutation pattern by counting points in linear polyhedra.  As a result, the counting sequences (with respect to the Coxeter length statistic) always satisfy a linear constant-coefficient recurrence.  We also investigate when the counting sequence is periodic.

<B> Drew Armstrong, Christopher R. H. Hanusa, and Brant C. Jones, <I>Results and conjectures on simultaneous core partitions</I></B><P>
<BR>
An n-core partition is an integer partition whose diagram contains no hook lengths equal to n. We prove that the self-conjugate (2n, 2mn+1)-core partitions correspond naturally to dominant alcoves in the m-Shi arrangement of type C_n, generalizing a result of Fishel--Vazirani for type A. We also introduce a major statistic on simultaneous (n, n+1)-core partitions and on self-conjugate simultaneous (2n, 2n+1)-core partitions that yield q-analogues of the type A and type C Coxeter-Catalan numbers.

<B> Laura Bradford, Meredith Harris, Brant Jones, Alex Komarinski, Carly Matson, and Edwin O'Shea, <I>The Refined Lecture Hall Theorem via Abacus Diagrams</I></B><P>
<BR>
Bousquet-Melou & Eriksson's lecture hall theorem generalizes Euler's celebrated distinct-odd partition theorem. We present an elementary and short proof of the lecture hall theorem using a simple bijection involving abacus diagrams.

<B> Brant Jones, Laura Taalman and Anthony Tongen, <I>Solitaire Mancala Games and the Chinese Remainder Theorem</I></B><P>
<BR>
We study the solitaire mancala game Tchoukaillon, including a new description of all winning Tchoukaillon boards with a given length, and an algorithm to reconstruct a complete winning Tchoukaillon board from partial information.  We also propose a graph-theoretic generalization of Tchoukaillon for further study.

<B> Rebecca Field and Brant Jones, <I>Using carry-truncated addition to analyze add-rotate-xor hash algorithms</I></B><P>
<BR>
We study a parameterized addition operation on n-bit binary numbers that interpolates between ordinary addition (mod 2^n) and bitwise addition (in Z_2^n).  We then use this truncated operation in place of ordinary addition in several add-rotate-xor hash algorithms that have appeared as finalists in the NIST competition.  We describe a theoretical attack and a new robustness metric for this class of algorithms.

<B> Brant Jones and Alexander Woo, <I>Mask formulas for cograssmannian Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials</I></B><P>
<BR>
We give two constructions of sets of masks on cograssmannian permutations that can be used in Deodhar's formula for Kazhdan-Lusztig basis elements of the Iwahori-Hecke algebra. The constructions are respectively based on a formula of Lascoux-Schutzenberger and its geometric interpretation by Zelevinsky.

<P><HR>
<B> Christopher R. H. Hanusa and Brant C. Jones, <I>Abacus models for parabolic quotients of affine Weyl groups</I></B><P>
<BR>
We introduce abacus diagrams that describe minimal length coset representatives in affine Weyl groups of types B, C, and D. These abacus diagrams use a realization of the affine Weyl group of type C due to Eriksson to generalize a construction of James for the symmetric group.

<B> Brant Jones and Anne Schilling, <I>Affine structures and a tableau model for E_6 crystals</I></B><P>
<BR>
We give the unique affine crystal structure for the type E_6^{(1)} Kirillov-Reshetikhin crystals that correspond to the leaf nodes of the finite E_6 Dynkin diagram.  We also introduce a tableau model for classical highest weight crystals of type E that generalizes a construction of Kashiwara--Nakashima.

<B> Hugh Denoncourt and Brant C. Jones, <I>The enumeration of maximally clustered permutations</I></B><P>
<BR>
We use heaps to show that the generating functions for certain fully-commutative pattern classes can be rationally transformed to give generating functions for the corresponding freely-braided and maximally clustered pattern classes.  The maximally clustered permutations are characterized by avoiding the classical permutation patterns 3421, 4312, and 4321.

<B> Christopher R. H. Hanusa and Brant C. Jones, <I>The enumeration of fully commutative affine permutations</I></B><P>
<BR>
We give a generating function for the fully commutative affine permutations enumerated by rank and Coxeter length.  This extends formulas due to Stembridge and Barcucci--Del Lungo--Pergola--Pinzani.  For fixed rank, the length generating functions have coefficients that are periodic with period dividing the rank.   Chris has some <A HREF="http://qcpages.qc.edu/~chanusa/papers/more/8.html">code</A> available on his website.

<P><HR>
<B> Brant C. Jones, <I>An explicit derivation of the Mobius function for Bruhat order</I></B><P>
<BR>
We give an explicit nonrecursive complete matching for the Hasse diagram of the strong Bruhat order of any interval in any Coxeter group. This yields a new derivation of the Mobius function, recovering a classical result due to Verma.

<B>Chris Berg, Brant Jones and Monica Vazirani, <I>A bijection on core partitions and a parabolic quotient of the affine symmetric group</I></B><P>
<BR>
We describe a bijection between $\ell$-core partitions with first part $k$ and $(\ell-1)$-core partitions with first part less than or equal to $k$, for fixed positive integers $\ell$ and $k$.  This bijection has a geometric interpretation in terms of the root lattice of type $A_{\ell-1}$ as well as a natural description in terms of another correspondence due to Lapointe--Morse.

<B>Brant C. Jones, <I>Leading coefficients of Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials for Deodhar elements</I></B><P>
<BR>
We show that the leading coefficient of the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomial $P_{x,w}(q)$ known as $\mu(x,w)$ is always either 0 or 1 when w is a Deodhar element of a finite Weyl group.
<BR>

<P><HR>
<B>Brant C. Jones, <I>Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials for maximally-clustered hexagon-avoiding permutations</I></B><P>
<BR>
We provide a non-recursive description for the bounded admissible sets of masks used by Deodhar's algorithm to calculate the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials $P_{x,w}(q)$ of type A, in the case when w is hexagon avoiding and maximally clustered.  We also briefly discuss the application of heaps to permutation pattern characterization.
<BR>

<P><HR>
<B>Sara C. Billey and Brant C. Jones, <I>Embedded factor patterns for Deodhar elements in Kazhdan-Lusztig theory</I></B><P>
<BR>
We define embedded factor pattern-avoidance for general Coxeter groups, and use it to characterize when Deodhar's (1990) algorithm yields a simple combinatorial formula for the Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials of finite Weyl groups.
